# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions by Khaun02

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! 🚀 This repo is where I document my problem-solving journey on LeetCode, including my thought process, code implementations, and improvements over time.

## 📌 About This Repository
- This repo serves as a **personal archive** of my LeetCode solutions, helping me track my progress and refine my coding skills.
- Each solution includes:
  - **Code implementation**
  - **My thought process**
  - **Edge cases considered**
  - **Optimizations (if applicable)**
- Over time, I aim to refine my problem-solving approach and build efficient, well-documented solutions.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each problem solution is stored in the following format:

📁 leetcode-solutions/ ├── 📂 easy/ │ ├── 217_contains_duplicate.java │ ├── ... ├── 📂 medium/ │ ├── ... ├── 📂 hard/ │ ├── ... ├── README.md

- **`easy/`** → Solutions for easy-level problems  
- **`medium/`** → Solutions for medium-level problems  
- **`hard/`** → Solutions for hard-level problems  

Each file is named using the **LeetCode problem number** and the problem name.

## 🛠️ How I Approach Problems
1. **Understand the problem statement** – Identify constraints and expected output.
2. **Plan a solution** – Think through possible approaches before coding.
3. **Write the initial implementation** – Get a basic working version first.
4. **Test edge cases** – Make sure it works for tricky cases.
5. **Optimize** – Improve time and space complexity when possible.
6. **Document the solution** – Add comments and commit the final version.

## 🔥 Recent Progress
Check out my **commit history** to see my learning process and improvements over time. Each commit follows a structured format like:

feat: implement semi-working containsDuplicate function fix: resolve index out of bounds in containsDuplicate feat: finalize optimized containsDuplicate implementation

## 📌 Future Plans
- Solve problems across different categories (Arrays, Strings, Graphs, DP, etc.)
- Improve solutions with **better time & space complexity**
- Add more **detailed explanations** per solution
