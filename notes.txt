# PUBLIC for classes

* if a class has "public" in it, then the class name has to match EXACTLY for the filename
* reason: When you compile a Java file, the compiler expects the filename and public class name to match exactly because:
            Java treats each .java file as a separate compilation unit.
            The compiler automatically looks for a file named after the public class.
            If the filename doesn’t match the public class name, the compiler can’t correctly map the source file to the compiled .class file.
